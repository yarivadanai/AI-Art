    text: "Measurement in quantum mechanics causes the wavefunction to collapse because the measuring instrument physically disturbs the particle. This is why Heisenberg's uncertainty principle exists: our instruments are too crude to measure without interfering.",
    answer: "The uncertainty principle is not about measurement disturbance. It is an intrinsic property of quantum systems arising from the wave nature of matter; conjugate variables like position and momentum cannot simultaneously have precise values regardless of measurement.",
    keywords: ["intrinsic", "not measurement", "wave nature", "conjugate variables", "not disturbance", "inherent"],

    text: "Einstein's theory of relativity shows that nothing can travel faster than light. This is because as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases to infinity, requiring infinite energy to accelerate further.",
    answer: "Relativistic mass is a deprecated concept. The modern understanding uses invariant (rest) mass, which does not change. The speed limit arises from the geometry of spacetime: not from mass increase but from the fact that spacetime intervals become spacelike beyond c.",
    keywords: ["relativistic mass", "deprecated", "invariant mass", "rest mass", "spacetime geometry", "spacetime"],
    explanation: "The 'mass increases with velocity' framing, while pedagogically common, is rejected by modern physics. The energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² uses invariant mass m. The speed limit is structural, not a consequence of mass divergence.",

    answer: "A p-value is the probability of seeing data this extreme IF the null hypothesis is true, not the probability the null is true. P-values do not measure effect probability. Replication with p < 0.05 doesn't multiply confidence the way described.",

    answer: "Atoms don't 'want' anything; bonding minimizes energy. The octet rule is a useful heuristic but has many exceptions (BF₃, SF₆, NO, free radicals). Ionic bonding exists on a spectrum with covalent bonding. 'Complete transfer' is an idealization.",

    text: "Entropy always increases, which means everything tends toward disorder. A messy room is a high-entropy state, and cleaning it decreases entropy, violating the second law. Life itself seems to violate the second law by creating order from disorder.",
    answer: "The second law applies to closed systems, and a room is not closed (you expend energy to clean it). 'Disorder' is a misleading gloss on entropy; it's about microstates, not messiness. Life doesn't violate the second law; it increases total entropy while locally decreasing it.",

    text: "Electricity flows through wires like water flows through a pipe. Electrons travel at nearly the speed of light from the power plant to your home, which is why the light turns on instantly when you flip a switch.",
    answer: "Electrons drift extremely slowly (millimeters per second). What propagates at near light speed is the electromagnetic field/wave that guides the energy. The water-pipe analogy breaks down because energy is carried in the fields outside the wire, not by the electrons inside it.",
    keywords: ["drift velocity", "electromagnetic field", "not electrons traveling", "Poynting vector", "slow drift", "field propagation"],

    field: "Anthropology",
    text: "Human societies naturally progressed from primitive hunter-gatherer bands to agricultural settlements to complex civilizations. This linear progression represents increasing social sophistication, and societies that remained hunter-gatherers were 'stuck' at an earlier stage.",
    answer: "Social evolution is not linear or progressive. Many societies deliberately chose foraging over agriculture. Agricultural societies often had worse nutrition, health, and equality. Complexity can decrease, and some cultures oscillated between modes of subsistence.",
    keywords: ["not linear", "not progressive", "deliberate choice", "worse nutrition", "not stuck", "non-linear"],

    field: "Pharmacology",
    text: "Drugs work by flooding the brain with chemicals that activate receptors. A higher dose always produces a stronger effect. Drug tolerance occurs because the body metabolizes the drug faster after repeated exposure.",
    answer: "Many drugs work as antagonists (blocking receptors), not agonists. Dose-response curves plateau and can even show paradoxical effects at high doses (hormesis). Tolerance involves receptor downregulation, desensitization, and neuroadaptation, not just faster metabolism.",
    keywords: ["antagonist", "receptor downregulation", "not just metabolism", "dose-response", "desensitization", "neuroadaptation"],

    text: "The Western 12-tone equal temperament system is mathematically perfect because it divides the octave into twelve equal semitones based on natural harmonic ratios. This is why it sounds 'right': it aligns with the physics of sound.",
    answer: "Equal temperament deliberately deviates from natural harmonic ratios, and that's the whole point. Pure intervals (like 3:2 fifths) don't divide evenly into 12 steps. ET is a compromise that makes every key equally slightly 'out of tune' to enable free modulation.",
    keywords: ["compromise", "deviates from natural", "not perfect", "equally out of tune", "tempered", "modulation"],

    text: "Airplane wings generate lift because air moves faster over the curved top surface than the flat bottom, creating a pressure difference according to Bernoulli's principle. The 'equal transit time' theory explains why the air must speed up over the top.",
    answer: "The 'equal transit time' theory is false: there is no physical law requiring air parcels split at the leading edge to rejoin at the trailing edge. In reality, air over the top arrives FIRST. Lift is better explained by the wing deflecting air downward (Newton's third law) combined with circulation.",
    keywords: ["equal transit time", "false", "Newton's third law", "deflection", "circulation", "arrives first"],

    field: "Optics",
    text: "Mirrors reverse left and right, which is why text appears backwards in a mirror. This lateral reversal is a fundamental property of reflection and explains why your left hand appears as a right hand in the mirror.",
    answer: "Mirrors do not reverse left and right. They reverse front and back (the depth axis perpendicular to the mirror). The apparent 'lateral reversal' occurs because we mentally rotate our image 180° around the vertical axis to compare it to a face-to-face view.",
    keywords: ["front and back", "depth axis", "not left-right", "mental rotation", "perpendicular", "parity"],

    text: "Herd immunity is achieved when a fixed percentage of the population is vaccinated, at which point the disease can no longer spread at all. The herd immunity threshold is a constant property of each disease that doesn't change over time.",
    answer: "The herd immunity threshold (1 - 1/R₀) assumes uniform random mixing, which never occurs in real populations. The threshold varies with contact patterns, population structure, waning immunity, and viral evolution. Diseases don't stop spreading entirely; transmission drops below replacement rate.",

But if the host opens randomly and happens to reveal a goat, the probability IS 50/50, and the host's intent matters because it changes the conditional probability structure.",
    keywords: ["host's protocol", "conditional on rules", "not always 2/3", "random host", "information depends on intent", "protocol matters"],
    explanation: "This is a meta-expert-trap: the standard Monty Hall explanation is correct but glosses over the crucial assumption about the host's behavior. The problem is ill-defined without specifying whether the host MUST open a losing door. Under different host protocols, the optimal strategy changes, a nuance most explainers miss.",

    text: "The 'hot hand' in basketball (the idea that players go on shooting streaks) was debunked by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky in 1985. Their study proved that the hot hand is a cognitive illusion caused by humans seeing patterns in random sequences. Streaks in basketball shooting are fully explained by random variation.",
    answer: "The hot hand was actually 'un-debunked' by Miller and Sanjurjo (2018), who discovered a subtle but significant statistical bias in the original analysis. When you select sequences conditional on observing a streak, the expected proportion of hits AFTER hits is below the true probability, not equal to it. The original study's null hypothesis was wrong. Recent analyses with better data confirm a modest but real hot hand effect.",
    keywords: ["Miller and Sanjurjo", "statistical bias", "un-debunked", "selection bias", "conditional expectation", "real effect"],
    explanation: "This is a fascinating case of a correction to a correction. The GVT study became a textbook example of cognitive bias for decades. But Miller and Sanjurjo showed the analysis contained a subtle mathematical error: the expected shooting percentage after hits in a finite sequence is systematically below the base rate, meaning the 'null result' actually supported a hot hand.",

    text: "Coral reefs are built by coral animals that secrete calcium carbonate skeletons. Coral bleaching occurs when rising ocean temperatures kill the coral. Once bleached, coral is dead and the reef will not recover. Ocean acidification dissolves coral skeletons like acid dissolving chalk.",
    answer: "Bleaching occurs when corals EXPEL their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae, not when the coral dies. Bleached coral is stressed but alive and can recover if conditions improve within weeks to months. Acidification reduces calcification rates and weakens existing structures, but it doesn't rapidly 'dissolve' reefs like acid on chalk, as the chemistry is more nuanced (reduced carbonate ion saturation state).",
    keywords: ["expel zooxanthellae", "still alive", "can recover", "reduced calcification", "not dissolved", "saturation state"],
    explanation: "Expert traps: 'bleaching = death' (bleached coral is stressed, not dead, and recovery is possible), and 'dissolves like chalk' (ocean acidification shifts carbonate chemistry equilibria, reducing new calcification rather than rapidly dissolving existing structures). The reality is still alarming but mechanistically different.",

    field: "Thermoacoustics",
    text: "Sound is purely a mechanical wave that carries energy through pressure oscillations but has no thermal effects. Acoustic waves propagate adiabatically through air because the compressions and rarefactions happen too quickly for heat exchange. Therefore, sound cannot heat or cool anything.",
    answer: "Sound DOES have thermal effects: the compressions are slightly non-adiabatic, and acoustic energy is ultimately dissipated as heat through viscous and thermal losses. Thermoacoustic engines exploit the interaction between sound waves and temperature gradients to create heat pumps and refrigerators. High-intensity ultrasound demonstrably heats tissue (used in medical therapy).",
    keywords: ["thermoacoustic", "viscous losses", "heat dissipation", "not purely adiabatic", "ultrasound heating", "temperature gradients"],
    explanation: "While the adiabatic approximation is excellent for everyday sound, it breaks down at boundaries and at high intensities. Thermoacoustic devices (Stirling-like engines with no moving parts) use standing waves to pump heat. Ultrasound therapy exploits acoustic heating for deep tissue treatment.",

The major scale sounds 'happy' and the minor scale sounds 'sad' because of universal properties of human auditory perception. Other cultures' music systems are simplified versions of Western harmony.",
    answer: "Major/minor emotional associations are culturally learned, not universal, and studies of isolated populations (Mafa people of Cameroon) show they don't make the same associations. Many musical traditions use scales not derivable from Western theory (Indonesian gamelan slendro/pelog, Arabic maqam, Indian raga). These are complete, sophisticated systems, not simplified Western music.",
    keywords: ["culturally learned", "not universal", "gamelan", "maqam", "raga", "not simplified"],
    explanation: "Western music theory universalism is ethnocentric. The harmonic series is physical, but which intervals are selected as consonant is culturally mediated. Javanese gamelan uses intervals not found in 12-TET. Indian classical music has a far more elaborate melodic-modal system (raga) than Western major/minor. The 'happy/sad' association fails cross-culturally.",

    answer: "Deleted files typically remain on disk until overwritten, and forensic tools (EnCase, Autopsy) routinely recover them. Standard formatting only removes filesystem metadata, not data itself (secure erase or overwriting is needed). Incognito mode only prevents local browser history; ISPs, employers, and websites still track you. No encryption is 'absolutely unbreakable'; it's computationally infeasible to break, which is a practical, not absolute, guarantee.",
    keywords: ["recoverable", "metadata only", "ISP tracking", "not absolute", "forensic recovery", "still on disk"],
    explanation: "Multiple expert traps: deletion only removes directory entries (data persists), formatting removes filesystem structures but not sector data, incognito mode's privacy is limited to the local machine, and encryption security rests on computational assumptions (which quantum computing may eventually challenge for some algorithms).",

    answer: "The passage is largely correct but contains a subtle error in the analogy: gravitational waves are NOT like 'waves on a pond.' Surface water waves are transverse in a 2D medium; gravitational waves are transverse quadrupolar distortions of spacetime itself, and they stretch space in one direction while compressing it perpendicularly. There is no medium, and the wave IS the spacetime distortion, not a wave propagating through spacetime.",
    keywords: ["quadrupolar", "no medium", "spacetime itself", "not in a medium", "stretch and compress", "plus and cross polarization"],
    explanation: "This is a subtle trap because most of the passage is accurate. The pond analogy fails because it implies a medium and transverse displacement, while gravitational waves are deformations OF spacetime. They have unique plus and cross polarization modes that have no classical wave analog.",

    answer: "The human proteome contains over 1 million distinct protein species, far more than 20,000. Alternative splicing allows a single gene to produce multiple protein variants. Post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination) further expand diversity. The proteome is dynamic and tissue-specific, while the genome is (mostly) static and identical across cells.",
    keywords: ["alternative splicing", "post-translational", "over million proteins", "not one-to-one", "dynamic", "tissue-specific"],
    explanation: "The one-gene-one-protein model was outdated by the 1990s. The DSCAM gene in Drosophila alone can produce 38,016 different mRNA variants through alternative splicing. Post-translational modifications add another layer of enormous combinatorial diversity that is invisible at the genomic level.",

    text: "Pure water is a perfect insulator that doesn't conduct electricity. The reason tap water conducts electricity is because of dissolved minerals and salts. This is why distilled water is safe to handle around electrical equipment and why deionized water has zero conductivity.",
    answer: "Even ultrapure water has a small but measurable conductivity (0.055 µS/cm at 25°C) because water autoionizes: H₂O ⇌ H⁺ + OH⁻ (Kw = 10⁻¹⁴). It's an extremely poor conductor but not a 'perfect insulator.' Deionized water has very low conductivity but not zero. Additionally, ultrapure water is actually more aggressive chemically (it readily dissolves materials to reach ionic equilibrium).",
    keywords: ["autoionization", "not zero conductivity", "Kw", "not perfect insulator", "self-ionization", "ultrapure aggressive"],
    explanation: "The 'pure water is an insulator' claim oversimplifies water's autoionization equilibrium. At any moment, some water molecules have dissociated into H⁺ and OH⁻ ions, providing inherent (if minimal) conductivity. The practical implication is important: ultrapure water is never truly non-conducting.",

    answer: "Removing protected attributes doesn't prevent discrimination, as correlated features (zip code, name, browsing patterns) serve as proxies. High overall accuracy can mask severe disparities across subgroups (a model that's 95% accurate overall might be 60% accurate for minorities). Multiple incompatible mathematical definitions of fairness exist, and satisfying all simultaneously is provably impossible (Chouldechova's theorem).",
    keywords: ["proxy features", "disparate impact", "subgroup disparity", "incompatible definitions", "Chouldechova", "not just accuracy"],
    explanation: "Expert traps: attribute removal (features correlate, so removing race doesn't prevent redlining via zip code), accuracy-as-fairness (aggregate metrics hide subgroup performance), and the assumption that 'fairness' has a single definition (different fairness criteria are mathematically incompatible except in trivial cases).",

    answer: "The relationship is bidirectional: orbital changes initiate warming, which releases oceanic CO₂, which amplifies warming through a positive feedback loop. The fact that CO₂ was a feedback in the past doesn't preclude it being a forcing today. Current CO₂ rise is from fossil fuels (verified by isotopic signature ¹³C/¹²C decline), which is a different mechanism from past natural cycles.",
    keywords: ["feedback loop", "bidirectional", "isotopic signature", "forcing vs feedback", "amplification", "13C"],
    explanation: "This is a sophisticated climate skeptic argument that exploits the lag between temperature and CO₂ in ice cores. The lag proves CO₂ was a feedback in past cycles, but feedback and forcing are not mutually exclusive. The isotopic carbon signature (δ¹³C decline) proves current CO₂ is from fossil sources, acting as a forcing, not a feedback.",

    text: "Genes are turned on and off like switches by transcription factors. Gene regulation is a linear process: a signal activates a transcription factor, which binds DNA and turns on a target gene, which produces a protein. Understanding individual gene circuits allows us to predict cell behavior.",
    answer: "Gene regulation is highly nonlinear: transcription factors form complex combinatorial networks with feedback loops, epigenetic memory, and stochastic noise. The same gene can be regulated by dozens of factors simultaneously. Gene regulatory networks exhibit emergent behaviors (bistability, oscillations) that cannot be predicted from individual circuits. Single-cell studies reveal substantial cell-to-cell variability even in genetically identical populations.",
    keywords: ["nonlinear", "feedback loops", "stochastic", "emergent", "combinatorial", "cell-to-cell variability"],
    explanation: "The 'switch' metaphor dramatically oversimplifies gene regulation. Real promoters integrate signals from many transcription factors, chromatin state, and non-coding RNAs. Stochastic gene expression means genetically identical cells can have very different protein levels. Network motifs create complex dynamical behaviors unpredictable from components alone.",

The resolution proves that information processing always requires energy, supporting the view that thermodynamics and information theory are separate domains that happen to connect.",
    answer: "The modern resolution (Landauer's principle, refined by Bennett) shows that it's the ERASURE of information, not the observation/measurement, that dissipates energy (kT ln 2 per bit). The demon CAN observe without energy cost but must eventually erase its memory, restoring the second law. Far from being separate domains, thermodynamics and information theory are deeply unified: entropy IS a measure of missing information.",
    keywords: ["erasure not observation", "Landauer's principle", "Bennett", "kT ln 2", "deeply unified", "memory erasure"],
    explanation: "The passage gets the resolution half-right but misidentifies the crucial step. Szilard and Brillouin thought measurement cost energy; Bennett showed a reversible measurement is possible. The irreversible step is memory erasure. This actually demonstrates thermodynamics and information are fundamentally unified, not merely connected.",
