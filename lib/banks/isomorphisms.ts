    keywords: ["purifying selection", "deleterious mutation", "selective sweep", "negative selection", "functional constraint"],
    explanation: "Purifying (negative) selection actively removes deleterious mutations from functional genes, just as a compiler actively proves and removes dead code.

    keywords: ["resonance", "amplification", "populism", "propaganda", "echo", "radicalization"],
    explanation: "Political messaging that matches the 'natural frequency' of a population's anxieties or desires causes maximal amplification of those sentiments, and small rhetorical inputs produce outsized emotional and behavioral responses when frequency-matched.",

    sourceConcept: "Chirality and enantiomers",
    sourceDescription: "Two molecules can have the same atoms and bonds but be non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Despite identical composition, they can have profoundly different biological effects: one enantiomer may be therapeutic while the other is toxic.",

    answer: "Structurally identical policies with opposite effects depending on context or implementation direction",
    keywords: ["implementation", "context-dependent", "mirror policy", "same structure different outcome", "framing effect"],
    explanation: "Two policies with identical structural components but implemented in mirror-image ways (e.g., opt-in vs opt-out organ donation) can have profoundly different outcomes. Like enantiomers, the 'handedness' of implementation determines the effect.",

  {
    sourceField: "Distributed Systems",
    sourceConcept: "CAP theorem",
    sourceDescription: "In a distributed data store, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee Consistency (all nodes see the same data), Availability (every request gets a response), and Partition tolerance (the system continues despite network splits). You must sacrifice one.",

    answer: "The impossibility of simultaneously maximizing liberty, equality, and community",
    keywords: ["trilemma", "impossible trinity", "tradeoff", "liberty equality", "political impossibility"],

  {
    sourceField: "Organic Chemistry",
    sourceConcept: "Activation energy and transition state",
    sourceDescription: "For a chemical reaction to proceed, reactants must overcome an energy hill (the activation energy) passing through an unstable transition state. Without sufficient energy to reach the transition state, the reaction simply does not occur.",

    answer: "The initial effort barrier that prevents habit formation even when the new habit is beneficial",
    keywords: ["activation energy", "habit formation", "inertia", "behavior change barrier", "initial effort"],
    explanation: "People remain in suboptimal behaviors because the 'activation energy' required to change (learning, discomfort, effort) exceeds their available motivation, even though the 'products' (new habits) are lower-energy than the 'reactants' (old habits).",
  },
  {
    sourceField: "Signal Processing",
    sourceConcept: "Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem",
    sourceDescription: "To perfectly reconstruct a continuous signal from discrete samples, you must sample at more than twice the signal's highest frequency component. Sampling below this rate produces aliasing: false patterns that weren't in the original signal.",

    answer: "Infrequent polling or reporting that creates false narratives through undersampling",
    keywords: ["aliasing", "undersampling", "false narrative", "polling frequency", "misrepresentation"],

    answer: "Contrarian advantage where uncommon market strategies outperform until widely adopted",
    keywords: ["contrarian", "first mover", "blue ocean", "uncommon strategy", "frequency dependent"],
    explanation: "A business strategy's profitability depends on how many competitors use it: rare strategies (blue ocean) yield high returns, but as more firms adopt them, returns diminish. This is negative frequency-dependent selection in markets.",
  },
  {
    sourceField: "Crystallography",
    sourceConcept: "Grain boundaries and polycrystalline structure",
    sourceDescription: "Most metals are not single crystals but polycrystals: many small crystalline grains with different orientations. The boundaries between grains are regions of atomic mismatch that impede dislocation movement and thereby strengthen the material.",
    targetField: "Organizational Design",
    answer: "Cross-functional team boundaries that create productive friction and prevent groupthink",
    keywords: ["cross-functional", "boundary", "productive friction", "diversity", "interdepartmental"],
    explanation: "Organizations with diverse teams of different 'orientations' (disciplines, perspectives) are stronger than monocultures, and the boundaries between groups create friction that impedes the propagation of errors (dislocations) and strengthens the whole.",

  {
    sourceField: "Thermodynamics",
    sourceConcept: "Maxwell's demon",
    sourceDescription: "A thought experiment where a hypothetical being sorts fast and slow molecules between two chambers, apparently decreasing entropy without work. Resolution: the demon must expend energy to acquire and erase information about each molecule.",

    keywords: ["information cost", "curation cost", "knowledge management", "sorting cost", "data maintenance"],

    sourceField: "Music Theory",
    sourceConcept: "Harmonic resolution: tension and release",

    answer: "Dramatic tension and resolution in storytelling: conflict followed by catharsis",
    keywords: ["tension", "resolution", "catharsis", "dramatic arc", "conflict resolution", "narrative arc"],

    keywords: ["critical dependency", "core library", "keystone dependency", "left-pad", "foundational service"],
    explanation: "Some small, seemingly minor software packages (like left-pad or OpenSSL) have disproportionate systemic importance, and their removal or failure cascades through the entire software ecosystem, just as removing a keystone species collapses an ecosystem.",

    keywords: ["critical mass", "self-sustaining", "chain reaction", "social movement", "threshold", "committed minority"],

    keywords: ["resolution limit", "granularity", "survey precision", "measurement limit", "question granularity"],
    explanation: "Just as light's wavelength sets a floor on optical resolution, the coarseness of survey instruments (Likert scales, binary questions) sets a floor on the granularity of psychological constructs you can resolve, and no statistical technique can extract sub-question precision.",
