Substitute: a² − b² = c·(a·cos(B) − b·cos(A)). But also from the projection formula, a·cos(B) = (a² + c² − b²)/(2c). Substituting and simplifying yields (a² − b²)(1 − 1) = 0\nStep 7: The factor (1 − 1) = 0 makes this trivially true. But dividing both sides by (a² − b²), we get 0/(a² − b²) = 0, which is valid.

    "prompt": "Proof: \"Proof that the Cantor set has positive measure\"\n\nStep 1: The Cantor set C is constructed from [0,1] by iteratively removing open middle thirds. We compute the Lebesgue measure of C.\nStep 2: At step 1, remove the open middle third (1/3, 2/3), which has length 1/3. Remaining measure: 1 − 1/3 = 2/3.\nStep 3: At step 2, remove the middle thirds of the two remaining intervals: (1/9, 2/9) and (7/9, 8/9). Each has length 1/9, and there are 2 such intervals. Total removed: 2 · (1/9) = 2/9.\nStep 4: At step 3, remove the middle thirds of the four remaining intervals. Each has length 1/27, and there are 4 such intervals. Total removed: 4 · (1/27) = 4/27.\nStep 5: In general, at step n, we remove 2ⁿ⁻¹ intervals each of length 1/3ⁿ. Wait: let us recount. At step n, the number of intervals removed equals the number of remaining intervals from the previous step: at step 1 we have 2 intervals remaining, step 2 gives 4, so at step n we remove 2ⁿ⁻¹ intervals, but each interval at step n has length 3⁻ⁿ. The total removed at step n is 2ⁿ⁻¹ · 3⁻ⁿ.\nStep 6: The total measure removed over all steps is Σₙ₌₁^∞ 2ⁿ⁻¹ · 3⁻ⁿ = (1/3) · Σₙ₌₁^∞ (2/3)ⁿ⁻¹ · (1/3)⁰ ... Let us compute directly: Σₙ₌₁^∞ 2ⁿ⁻¹/3ⁿ = (1/3)·Σₖ₌₀^∞ (2/3)ᵏ = (1/3)·(1/(1−2/3)) = (1/3)·3 = 1. Wait, that gives total removed = 1, leaving measure 0. Recheck: actually at step n we remove 2ⁿ⁻¹ intervals but some of those intervals overlap with previously removed portions. Accounting for overlap, the net new removal at step n is strictly less than 2ⁿ⁻¹ · 3⁻ⁿ.\nStep 7: After correcting for overlaps, the total removed is strictly less than 1. Therefore the Cantor set has measure 1 − (total removed) > 0.\nStep 8: The Cantor set has positive Lebesgue measure. ∎\n\nIdentify the error in this proof.",

      "There are NO overlaps in the Cantor set construction. At each step, the intervals being removed are open middle thirds of the REMAINING closed intervals: they are disjoint from all previously removed intervals by construction. The 'overlap correction' in step 5 is entirely fictitious. The correct computation is: total removed = Σₙ₌₁^∞ 2ⁿ⁻¹/3ⁿ = 1, so the Cantor set has measure 1 − 1 = 0. The proof introduces a spurious correction to avoid the conclusion that the measure is zero, which is in fact the correct answer.",
